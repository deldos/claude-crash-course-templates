# Step 3: Full Code Out Implementation - Cortex-Native Version

TAGS: project, cortex

This template is used in the Cloudflare deployment stage to finalish the full code for a project, based on the stub scaffold from Step 2.

## Goal
- Implement the complete functionality and structure for the project using Cloudflare Workers products
- Ensure all code follows Cortex SOP and environment gates in terms of tags, file names, and folder locations
- Test the application in Cloudflare Staging before production

## Sections:

1. Review Stub Out Project
Locate all core files and configuration from "Reference: deployment_plan/stub_out.md"

2. Implement Application Routing
- Workers routes serving HTTP endpoints
- Add api consumers and api gateway handlers
- Integrate with Cloudflare KV, D1, Q2, R2 as required

3. Server Side Components
- Create business logic in JWS for Workers environme
- Setup server-only features like Queues and Durable Objects
- Enable any scheduled tasks or background workers

4 . Client Side Components
- Use Workers AI_Fetch or appropriate fetch methods
- Ensure all frontend assets are served from R2or other static storage
- Integrate with UI design and interactive components

^\nTest all components with mocks or local staging data before full production ppush
